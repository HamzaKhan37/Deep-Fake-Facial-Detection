# Fake Face Detection with Explainability

This repository contains a project for detecting fake faces using a deep learning model. The model is built using `InceptionResnetV1` pretrained on the `vggface2` dataset and incorporates the `GradCAM` technique to provide visual explanations for the model's predictions.

## Overview

This project leverages `MTCNN` for face detection and `InceptionResnetV1` for face classification. The model is trained to distinguish between real and fake faces and provides visual explanations for its predictions using `GradCAM`.

## Features

- **Face Detection**: Uses `MTCNN` to detect faces in images.
- **Fake Face Detection**: Classifies faces as either real or fake using `InceptionResnetV1`.
- **Explainability**: Provides visual explanations for predictions using `GradCAM`.
- **Interactive Interface**: Uses `Gradio` to create an interactive web interface for users to upload images and get predictions.

## Installation

To run this project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/fake-face-detection.git
    cd fake-face-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
    ```sh
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required packages:
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Download the pre-trained model checkpoint and place it in the project directory.

## Usage

### Interactive Interface

You can launch an interactive web interface using Gradio by running:

```sh
python app.py
```

This will launch a web interface where you can upload an image and get predictions along with visual explanations.

### Batch Processing

To process a batch of images and evaluate model performance, follow these steps:

1. Place your images in a ZIP file and update the paths in the script.

2. Run the script to extract images, make predictions, and calculate metrics:

    ```sh
    python batch_processing.py
    ```

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the interactive interface:

### Visual Explanation

The model provides visual explanations for its predictions using GradCAM:

## Evaluation

You can calculate accuracy and confusion matrix metrics for your test dataset. Here's how:

```sh
python evaluate.py
```

This script will print the accuracy and confusion matrix, and save a visualization of the confusion matrix.
